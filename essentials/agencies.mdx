## Image

### Using Markdown

The [markdown syntax](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/#images) lets you add images using the following code

```md
![title](/path/image.jpg)
```

Note that the image file size must be less than 5MB. Otherwise, we recommend hosting on a service like [Cloudinary](https://cloudinary.com/) or [S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/). You can then use that URL and embed.

### Using Embeds

To get more customizability with images, you can also use [embeds](/writing-content/embed) to add images

```html
<img height="200" src="/path/image.jpg" />
```

## Embeds and HTML elements

<iframe
  width="560"
  height="315"
  src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4KzFe50RQkQ"
  title="YouTube video player"
  frameBorder="0"
  allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"
  allowFullScreen
  style={{ width: '100%', borderRadius: '0.5rem' }}
></iframe>

<br />

<Tip>

Mintlify supports [HTML tags in Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/#html). This is helpful if you prefer HTML tags to Markdown syntax, and lets you create documentation with infinite flexibility.

</Tip>

### iFrames

Loads another HTML page within the document. Most commonly used for embedding videos.

```html
<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4KzFe50RQkQ"> </iframe>
```
