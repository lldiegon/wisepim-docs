# Exporting Products

Exporting products from WISEPIM allows you to send your enriched product data to e-commerce platforms, download files for other systems, or create backups of your catalog. This guide covers all export options and helps you get your products where they need to go.

## Best Practices

### Before Exporting

1. **Test Your Integration**: Always test platform connections first
