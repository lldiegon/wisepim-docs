# Importing Products

Importing products into WISEPIM allows you to quickly populate your catalog from existing e-commerce platforms or upload data from spreadsheets. This guide will walk you through all available import options and help you get your products into the system efficiently.

<Info>
Before importing from e-commerce platforms, you'll need to configure and test your integrations in the **Integrations** section. CSV imports are always available without additional setup.
</Info>

## What You Can Import From

WISEPIM supports importing products from multiple sources:

- **E-commerce Platforms**: Shopify, WooCommerce, Magento, LightSpeed
- **File Formats**: CSV files with advanced mapping
- **Other Systems**: WebshopImporter, Kaufland

## Before You Start

### Setting Up Platform Integrations

For e-commerce platform imports, you must first configure your integrations:

1. **Navigate to Integrations**: Go to the **Integrations** page from your main menu
2. **Choose Your Platform**: Select the platform you want to connect (Shopify, WooCommerce, etc.)
3. **Enter Credentials**: Provide your API keys, store URLs, or login credentials
4. **Test Connection**: Use the test button to verify the connection works
5. **Save Configuration**: Once tested successfully, save your integration settings

<Warning>
You cannot import from a platform until its integration is properly configured and tested. The import modal will only show platforms that have been successfully set up.
</Warning>

Platform imports can take several minutes to hours depending on how many products you have. You can continue working in WISEPIM while the import runs in the background.
</Info>

## CSV Import Process

### Preparing Your CSV File

Before uploading, ensure your CSV file:

- **Has headers**: First row should contain column names
- **Uses UTF-8 encoding**: Prevents character display issues
- **Contains required fields**: At minimum, product names and SKUs
- **Follows consistent formatting**: Dates, prices, and categories in standard formats

### Upload and Mapping

1. **Select CSV Import**: Choose "CSV Import" from the import options
2. **Upload File**: You'll be redirected to the CSV importer page
3. **Map Columns**: Match your CSV columns to WISEPIM fields
4. **Validate Data**: Review any errors or warnings
5. **Start Import**: Begin the import process



### Advanced CSV Features

The CSV importer includes powerful features:

- **Auto-mapping**: Automatically suggests field mappings based on column names
- **Data validation**: Checks for errors before importing
- **Custom attributes**: Map to project-specific fields
- **Preview mode**: See how your data will look before importing
- **Error handling**: Clear reporting of any issues found

## Managing Import Progress

### Tracking Your Import

1. **Progress Notifications**: Toast messages show import status
2. **Background Processing**: Imports continue even if you navigate away
3. **Completion Alerts**: You'll be notified when the import finishes
4. **Error Reports**: Any issues are clearly reported

### What to Expect

**Small Catalogs** (under 100 products): Usually complete within minutes
**Medium Catalogs** (100-1,000 products): May take 10-30 minutes
**Large Catalogs** (1,000+ products): Can take several hours

<Tip>
Start with a small test import first to verify your integration is working correctly before importing your entire catalog.
</Tip>

## After Import Completion

### Reviewing Imported Products

1. **Check Product Count**: Verify the expected number of products were imported
2. **Review Product Data**: Spot-check a few products to ensure data quality
3. **Verify Categories**: Make sure product categories imported correctly
4. **Test Custom Fields**: If you have custom attributes, verify they populated

### Common Post-Import Tasks

1. **Set Review Status**: Mark products as reviewed after verification
2. **Enrich Descriptions**: Use AI to improve product descriptions
3. **Update Categories**: Organize products into your preferred category structure
4. **Configure Attributes**: Set up any additional custom fields needed

## Troubleshooting Import Issues

### "Import Failed" Messages

**Check Integration Status**:
- Verify your platform integration is still connected
- Test the connection in the Integrations page
- Re-enter credentials if needed

**Platform-Specific Issues**:
- **Shopify**: Check API permissions and rate limits
- **WooCommerce**: Verify REST API is enabled
- **Magento**: Confirm API user has proper permissions

### "No Products Found"

- **Empty Store**: Verify your platform actually has products
- **Permission Issues**: Check if your API user can access products
- **Filter Settings**: Some platforms may have visibility filters

### CSV Import Problems

**File Format Issues**:
- Save as CSV (UTF-8) format
- Remove any special characters in headers
- Ensure consistent data formatting

**Mapping Errors**:
- Required fields must be mapped
- Check data types match field requirements
- Verify custom attribute codes are correct

### Performance Issues

**Slow Imports**:
- Large catalogs naturally take longer
- Platform API rate limits may slow the process
- Network connectivity can affect speed

**Timeouts**:
- Try importing smaller batches
- Check your internet connection
- Contact support for very large catalogs

## Best Practices

### Before Importing

1. **Test Your Integration**: Always test platform connections first
2. **Start Small**: Import a few products initially to verify everything works
3. **Backup Existing Data**: Export current products before major imports
4. **Plan Your Structure**: Decide on categories and attributes beforehand

### During Import

1. **Monitor Progress**: Keep an eye on notifications and progress messages
2. **Don't Interrupt**: Avoid closing your browser during active imports
3. **Be Patient**: Large imports take time - let them complete

### After Import

1. **Quality Check**: Review imported data for accuracy
2. **Organize Products**: Set up proper categories and attributes
3. **Enrich Content**: Use AI tools to improve product descriptions
4. **Regular Updates**: Set up regular import schedules if needed
