# App Marketplace & Integrations

The App Marketplace is your gateway to connecting WISEPIM with various e-commerce platforms, marketplaces, and external systems. These integrations enable seamless data synchronization, allowing you to import products from existing stores and export enriched product data to multiple sales channels.

<Info>
Integrations are the bridge between WISEPIM and your existing e-commerce ecosystem. They eliminate manual data entry and ensure your product information stays synchronized across all platforms.

## Attribute Mapping

### Understanding Attribute Mapping

**Purpose**: Attribute mapping defines how data fields from external platforms correspond to your WISEPIM product attributes. This ensures data imports correctly and exports maintain proper formatting.

**Mapping Types**:
- **Direct Mapping**: One-to-one field correspondence
- **Transformation Mapping**: Data conversion during transfer
- **Conditional Mapping**: Rules-based field assignment
- **Custom Mapping**: Platform-specific field handling

### Setting Up Mappings

**Access Mapping Interface**:
1. Configure your integration connection first
2. Click "Map Attributes" for the specific integration
3. Review source fields from the external platform
4. Map to corresponding WISEPIM attributes
5. Save mapping configuration for future syncs

**Mapping Process**:
- **Source Attributes**: Fields available from the external platform
- **Target Attributes**: Your WISEPIM product attributes
- **Mapping Rules**: How data should be transformed or combined
- **Validation**: Ensure mappings work with sample data

### Common Mapping Scenarios

**Basic Product Information**:
- Product Title → Name
- Description → Product Description
- Price → Cost or Selling Price
- SKU → Product Identifier
- Images → Product Images

**Variant Attributes**:
- Color → Main Color attribute
- Size → Apparel Size attribute
- Material → Product Material
- Weight → Shipping Weight
- Dimensions → Product Dimensions

**Category and Organization**:
- Product Categories → WISEPIM Categories
- Tags → Product Tags or Keywords
- Brand → Brand attribute
- Collection → Product Line or Series

**Platform-Specific Fields**:
- SEO Title → Meta Title
- SEO Description → Meta Description
- Handle/Slug → URL Slug
- Vendor → Supplier or Manufacturer
