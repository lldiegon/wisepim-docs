Welcome to your product management hub! This page is where you'll spend most of your time organizing, editing, and enriching your product catalog. Whether you're managing dozens or thousands of products, this guide will help you work efficiently and get the most out of WISEPIM's powerful features.

## What You Can Do Here

- **View and organize** your entire product catalog in a customizable table
- **Search and filter** products to find exactly what you need
- **Edit products** individually or in bulk to save time
- **Enrich product descriptions** using AI to improve quality
- **Import and export** products from various platforms

## Understanding the Products Page Layout

When you first arrive at the Products page, you'll see:

- **Filter and column buttons** to customize your view
- **Bulk action buttons** on the top right (Import, Export, Bulk Edit, Enrich)
- **Product table** showing your products with sortable columns

## Finding Products Quickly

### Basic Search

The fastest way to find products is using the search bar:

The search looks across multiple fields at once, so you don't need to remember exactly which field contains your search term.
