# Managing Projects

Projects in WISEPIM help you organize and manage different sets of products, each with their own categories, attributes, and platform settings. Whether you're managing multiple brands, different product lines, or separate markets, projects provide the structure you need to keep everything organized.

<Info>
Each project can have its own custom attributes, categories, AI prompts, and integration settings, allowing you to tailor WISEPIM to your specific business needs.
</Info>

## What Projects Are For

Projects serve as containers for your product catalogs, allowing you to:

- **Organize Different Product Lines**: Separate products by brand, category, or market
- **Manage Multiple Brands**: Keep different brands' products and settings isolated
- **Handle Different Markets**: Create projects for different countries or regions
- **Test and Development**: Use separate projects for testing new configurations
- **Team Collaboration**: Assign different teams to different projects

## Understanding Project Structure

### Project Components

Each project contains:

- **Products**: Your product catalog with all associated data
- **Categories**: Product categorization specific to this project
- **Custom Attributes**: Project-specific product fields and properties
- **AI Prompts**: Customized prompts for product enrichment
- **Integration Settings**: Platform connections and configurations
- **Team Access**: User permissions and access controls

### Current Project Concept

WISEPIM uses a "current project" system:
- **One Active Project**: You work in one project at a time
- **Easy Switching**: Quickly switch between projects as needed
- **Context Preservation**: Each project maintains its own settings and views
- **Isolated Data**: Projects don't interfere with each other

### Project Actions Menu

Each project offers several actions:

**Set as Current Project**: Switch your workspace to this project
**Edit**: Modify project settings and configuration
**Duplicate**: Create a copy of the project with all its data
**Delete**: Remove the project and all its data (irreversible)

## Duplicating Projects

### When to Duplicate Projects

Duplication is useful for:
- **Creating Similar Projects**: Start with an existing structure
- **Testing Changes**: Make a copy before major modifications
- **Seasonal Variations**: Create variants for different seasons
- **Market Expansion**: Adapt existing projects for new markets

### Duplication Process

1. **Select Source Project**: Choose the project to duplicate
2. **Click Actions Menu**: Open the dropdown for that project
3. **Select "Duplicate"**: Choose the duplication option
4. **Confirm Action**: Approve the duplication process
5. **Wait for Completion**: The system will create the copy

### What Gets Duplicated

**Included in Duplication**:
- All products and their data
- Categories and category structure
- Custom attributes and attribute groups
- Platform integration profiles
- Project settings and configuration

**Not Included**:
- User access permissions (you'll be the owner)
- Integration API keys (for security)
- Historical data and logs

<Warning>
Project duplication can take several minutes to complete, especially for projects with many products. You'll receive a notification when it's finished.
</Warning>

## Deleting Projects

### Before You Delete

**Consider These Factors**:
- Deletion is permanent and cannot be undone
- All products, categories, and settings will be lost
- Team members will lose access to the project
- Integration connections will be removed

### Deletion Process

1. **Select Project to Delete**: Choose the project you want to remove
2. **Click Actions Menu**: Open the dropdown menu
3. **Select "Delete"**: Choose the deletion option
4. **Confirm Deletion**: Type confirmation or approve the action
5. **Wait for Completion**: The project will be permanently removed

<Warning>
You cannot delete your current project. Switch to a different project first, then delete the unwanted one.
</Warning>

## Project Organization Best Practices

### Naming Conventions

**Effective Project Names**:
- Use clear, descriptive names
- Include brand or product line identifiers
- Add market or language indicators
- Keep names concise but informative

**Examples**:
- "Acme Electronics - US Market"
- "Fashion Brand - EU Collection"
- "B2B Tools - German Market"
- "Seasonal Products - Holiday 2024"

### Project Structure Strategy

**By Business Unit**:
- Separate projects for different brands
- Individual projects for major product lines
- Distinct projects for B2B vs B2C

**By Market**:
- Geographic regions (US, EU, APAC)
- Language markets (English, German, French)
- Platform-specific projects (Amazon, Shopify)

**By Purpose**:
- Production projects for live data
- Testing projects for experiments
- Archive projects for historical data

### Team Access Planning

**Consider These Factors**:
- Who needs access to which projects
- Different permission levels for different roles
- Separation of sensitive or competitive data
- Collaboration requirements across teams

## Working Within Projects

### Project-Specific Features

**Custom Attributes**: Each project can have unique product fields
**Categories**: Project-specific product categorization
**AI Prompts**: Customized prompts for this project's needs
**Integrations**: Platform connections specific to this project

### Data Isolation

**Benefits of Isolation**:
- No cross-contamination between projects
- Independent settings and configurations
- Separate user access and permissions
- Individual backup and recovery options

### Project Context Awareness

**System Behavior**:
- All product operations apply to the current project only
- Imports and exports are project-specific
- AI enrichment uses project-specific prompts
- Reports and analytics are filtered by project

## Troubleshooting Project Issues

### "Cannot Switch Projects"

**Common Causes**:
- Insufficient permissions for the target project
- Project is inactive or archived
- System is processing a previous switch

**Solutions**:
- Check your access permissions
- Contact project administrator
- Wait for current operations to complete
- Refresh the page and try again

### "Project Creation Failed"

**Possible Issues**:
- Duplicate project name
- Invalid characters in project name
- Insufficient system resources
- Permission restrictions

**Solutions**:
- Choose a unique project name
- Use only letters, numbers, and basic punctuation
- Try again later if system is busy
- Contact administrator for permission issues

### "Duplication Taking Too Long"

**Normal Behavior**:
- Large projects take longer to duplicate
- Complex attribute structures increase time
- Many products require more processing

**When to Be Concerned**:
- Process stuck for over an hour
- No progress notifications received
- System appears unresponsive

## Advanced Project Management

### Project Templates

**Creating Templates**:
- Set up a "template" project with ideal configuration
- Include standard categories and attributes
- Configure default AI prompts
- Duplicate when creating new projects

### Project Archiving

**When to Archive**:
- Completed seasonal projects
- Discontinued product lines
- Historical data preservation
- Compliance requirements

**Archiving Process**:
- Export all project data first
- Set project status to inactive
- Remove active integrations
- Maintain for reference only

### Project Migration

**Between Environments**:
- Export project data as backup
- Create new project in target environment
- Import data using CSV or API
- Reconfigure integrations and settings
