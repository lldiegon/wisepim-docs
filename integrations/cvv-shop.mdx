# Configuring CCV Shop API Keys

To integrate WISEPIM with your CCV Shop store, you'll need to generate API keys. Follow these steps:

## Generate API Keys

1. Log in to your CCV Shop admin panel
2. Navigate to **Settings** → **API & Webhooks**
3. Click on the **API Keys** tab
4. Click the **Generate new API key** button
5. Fill in the following details:
   - **Description**: WISEPIM Integration (or any name you prefer)
   - **Permissions**: Make sure to enable both read and write permissions for products
6. Click **Save** to generate the API key
7. You will receive:
   - **API Key**
   - **API Secret**

Keep these credentials safe as you'll need to enter them in your WisePIM settings.

## Add API Keys to WISEPIM

1. Log in to your WisePIM account
2. Go to **Settings** → **Integrations**
3. Select **CCV Shop** from the list of available platforms
4. Enter your API credentials:
   - **API Key**: Your CCV Shop API key
   - **API Secret**: Your CCV Shop API secret
   - **Shop URL**: Your CCV Shop store URL (e.g., `https://your-store.ccvshop.com`)
5. Click **Save** to store your API configuration

## Security Best Practices

- Never share your API keys publicly
- Don't commit API keys to version control
- Store API keys securely using environment variables when possible
- Regularly rotate your API keys for enhanced security
- Only grant the minimum required permissions for the integration

## Testing the Connection

After saving your API configuration, you can test the connection:

1. In WISEPIM, go to the Integrations page
2. Find your CCV Shop connection
3. Click the **Test Connection** button
4. If successful, you'll see a confirmation message
5. If there's an error, verify your API credentials and shop URL
