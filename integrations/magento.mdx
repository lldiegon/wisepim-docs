## Authentication

To integrate with Magento 2, you'll need to set up API keys. Here's how to generate and configure them:

### Step 1: Generating API Keys

1. Log in to your Magento 2 Admin Panel
2. Navigate to **System** > **Integrations**
3. Click **Add New Integration**
4. Fill in the following details:
   - Name: Give your integration a descriptive name
   - Your Password: Enter your admin password
   - API: Select the resources this integration will have access to

### Step 2: Activating the Integration in Magento

1. After saving, click on the **Activate** link in the integrations grid
2. Review the permissions and click **Allow**
3. You'll receive four keys:
   - Consumer Key
   - Consumer Secret
   - Access Token
   - Access Token Secret

<Warning>
Never commit these keys directly to your code or version control. Always use environment variables or a secure secrets management system.
</Warning>

### Step 3: Configuring in WISEPIM

To configure your Magento API keys in WISEPIM:

1. Log in to your WisePIM admin panel
2. Navigate to **Settings** > **Integrations**
3. Click on the **Magento** integration tile
4. Enter your API credentials in the following fields:
   - Consumer Key
   - Consumer Secret
   - Access Token
   - Access Token Secret
5. Click **Save** to store your credentials

WISEPIM will securely encrypt and store these credentials for future use with your Magento integration.
