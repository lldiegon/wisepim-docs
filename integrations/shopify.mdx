## Setting Up Shopify API Keys

Before you can use the Shopify integration, you'll need to set up your API credentials. Here's how to get your API keys:

1. Log in to your [Shopify Partner Dashboard](https://partners.shopify.com)
2. Navigate to Apps > Create App
3. Choose "Create App Manually"
4. Fill in your app name and select the app type (Public or Custom)
5. Once created, go to "API credentials"
6. You'll need these credentials:
   - API Key
   - API Secret Key
   - Access Token (generated when installing the app in a store)

For security best practices:
- Store your API credentials in environment variables
- Never commit API keys to version control
- Rotate your API keys periodically
- Use appropriate scopes for your API access

Example environment variables setup:
```env
SHOPIFY_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
SHOPIFY_API_SECRET=your_api_secret_here
SHOPIFY_ACCESS_TOKEN=your_access_token_here
```
