# Configuring WooCommerce API Keys

To integrate WisePIM with your WooCommerce store, you'll need to generate API keys. Follow these steps:

1. Log in to your WordPress admin panel
2. Go to **WooCommerce** → **Settings** → **Advanced** → **REST API**
3. Click the **Add Key** button
4. Fill in the following details:
   - **Description**: WisePIM Integration (or any name you prefer)
   - **User**: Select an admin user
   - **Permissions**: Read/Write
5. Click **Generate API Key**
6. You will receive:
   - **Consumer Key**
   - **Consumer Secret**

Keep these credentials safe as you'll need to enter them in your WisePIM settings.

## Security Note
Never share your API keys publicly or commit them to version control. Store them securely and use environment variables when possible.
