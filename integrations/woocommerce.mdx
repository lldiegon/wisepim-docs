# Configuring WooCommerce API Keys

To integrate WisePIM with your WooCommerce store, you'll need to generate API keys. Follow these steps:

1. Log in to your WordPress admin panel
2. Go to **WooCommerce** → **Settings** → **Advanced** → **REST API**
3. Click the **Add Key** button
4. Fill in the following details:
   - **Description**: WisePIM Integration (or any name you prefer)
   - **User**: Select an admin user
   - **Permissions**: Read/Write
5. Click **Generate API Key**
6. You will receive:
   - **Consumer Key**
   - **Consumer Secret**

Keep these credentials safe as you'll need to enter them in your WisePIM settings.

## Security Note
Never share your API keys publicly or commit them to version control. Store them securely and use environment variables when possible.

## Adding API Keys to WisePIM

After generating your WooCommerce API keys, follow these steps to configure them in WISEPIM:

1. Log in to your WISEPIM account
2. Navigate to **Settings** → **Integrations**
3. Find and click on the **WooCommerce** integration tile
4. Fill in the following fields:
   - **Store URL**: Enter your WooCommerce store's URL (e.g., https://your-store.com)
   - **Consumer Key**: Paste the Consumer Key generated from WooCommerce
   - **Consumer Secret**: Paste the Consumer Secret generated from WooCommerce
5. Click **Test Connection** to verify your credentials
6. If the connection is successful, click **Save** to store your settings

Your WooCommerce integration is now configured and ready to use. You can start syncing your products between WisePIM and WooCommerce.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter connection issues:
- Verify that your store URL is correct and includes 'https://'
- Double-check that you've copied the API keys correctly
- Ensure your WooCommerce store is accessible and running
- Confirm that your WordPress site has REST API enabled
