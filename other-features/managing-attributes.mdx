# Managing Product Attributes

Product attributes are the custom fields that define what information you can store about your products. From basic details like color and size to complex specifications and technical data, attributes give you the flexibility to capture exactly the product information your business needs.

<Info>
Attributes are the building blocks of your product data structure. Well-organized attributes make it easier to manage products, create consistent data, and provide better customer experiences.
