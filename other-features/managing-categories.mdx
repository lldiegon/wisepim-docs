# Managing Product Categories

Product categories are the organizational structure that helps you group related products together. They create a logical hierarchy that makes it easier for customers to find products and for you to manage your catalog effectively. Well-organized categories improve both the customer experience and your operational efficiency.

<Info>
Categories serve as the backbone of your product organization. They help customers navigate your catalog, enable better filtering and search, and support platform integrations with marketplaces and e-commerce systems.
